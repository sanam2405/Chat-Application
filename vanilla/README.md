# Chat-Application

A real-time chat application where multiple users across different devices can join and chat with each other. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been used for the front-end, and Express.js for the back-end. The communication establishment has been done using Socket.IO.

## Steps to use it

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

   ```

4. Once the server started, you might see a message "Server running on port 3000".
